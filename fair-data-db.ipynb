    "### Problema\n",
    "Cada vez más los Datos y Algoritmos están presentes en los sistemas y/o dispositivos que influyen en la vida de las personas. Entendiendo a la persona como un individuo de la especie humana. \n",
    "\n",
    "En estos tiempos nos enfrentamos a un escenario caracterizado por diversas oportunidades, tensiones y desafíos que demandan compromisos a nivel individual, colectivo y ambiental. Los estados, empresas, organismos, u otras organizaciones habilitan espacios de reflexión y acción ante el impacto del uso de Datos, Ciencias de Datos e Inteligencia Artificial (IA) en las personas y en la naturaleza.\n",
    "\n",
    "¿Pueden las IA ser consideradas “autores/as” o “titulares de derechos”?. Para empezar a responder esta pregunta, de debate y reflexiòn en estos años, podemos empezar por investigar sobre la ley de derecho de autor y regulaciones en IA. \n",

    "### Objetivo\n",
    "Identificar caracterìsticas de los casos judiciales que los tribunales de EE.UU han determinado previamente como justos o no justos en relaciòn a los principios y a la aplicación del uso legítimo de la ley de derechos de autor. \n",
    "EE.UU es un paìs con antecedentes controversiales en relaciòn al cumplimiento y la flexibilidad de la ley de derecho de autor aplicada en empresas tecnològicas. Preguntas a considerar:\n",
    "* ¿Cuàles son los tipos de casos judiciales determinados por los tribunales de EE.UU?\n",
    "* ¿Cuàles son las categorìas de casos judiciales exploradas por los tribunales de EE.UU ?\n",
    "\n",
    "El Índice de Uso Justo  (Fair Use Index) rastrea una variedad de decisiones judiciales para ayudar a abogados y no abogados a comprender mejor los tipos de usos que los tribunales han determinado previamente como justos o no justos. Las decisiones abarcan múltiples jurisdicciones federales, incluida la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos, los tribunales de apelación de circuito y los tribunales de distrito. Tenga en cuenta que, si bien el Índice incorpora una amplia selección de casos, no incluye todas las opiniones judiciales sobre uso legítimo. \n",

In 1995, after obtaining permission from Picasso’s estate to publish a work illustrating and describing works by Picasso, Defendants Alan Wofsy and his company Alan Wofsy &amp; Associates began publishing The Picasso Project—–a series of volumes reproducing images of Picasso’s work, including 1,492 photographs from the Zervos Catalogue. Plaintiffs sued for copyright infringement. A French court held the photographs were protected by copyright because they “added creative features through deliberate choices of lighting, the lens, filters, [and] framing or angle of view.” In 2001, Plaintiffs obtained a judgment in France that subjected Defendants to damages for any further acts of infringement. In 2012, after discovering copies of The Picasso Project in a French bookstore, Plaintiffs enforced their judgment in France and were awarded €2 million. Plaintiffs sought recognition of the judgment in the U.S. courts. The district court granted summary judgment for Defendants, determining that the French judgment was “repugnant to U.S. public policy protecting free expression” because it failed to provide a fair use defense. Plaintiffs appealed; and Defendants cross-appealed on other defenses.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The panel held that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, weighed against fair use because Defendants conceded that The Picasso Project was a commercial venture and the use at issue—reproduction of the photographs in a book illustrating Picasso’s works—was not transformative. Specifically, the court noted that Defendants’ use “did not serve an ‘entirely different function’ than the originals,” but had overlapping purposes, and the insertion of informative captions did not “necessarily” transform the works. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, did not favor fair use because, although the works were published and documentary in nature, the French court had concluded that the photographs exhibited creative elements. The court determined that the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, weighed against fair use because Defendants failed to demonstrate that “copying the entirety of each photograph was necessary.” The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, also weighed against fair use because there is a presumption of market harm when the use is commercial and non-transformative. Although Defendants presented evidence that auction prices for the Zervos Catalogue increased while The Picasso Project was on the market, Defendants had not provided evidence that “widespread appropriation” of the works would not harm the market for the photographs. Weighing all the factors, the court had “serious doubts” that fair use would protect Defendants’ use, and, accordingly, granted summary judgment to Plaintiffs on the public policy defense.</td>\n",

Defendant Katherine Von Drachenberg, professionally known as Kat Von D, is a celebrity tattooist. In 2017, Kat Von D inked a tattoo on the arm of a friend, Blake Farmer, as a gift. Farmer chose the Portrait as the reference image for his tattoo. Kat Von D traced a printout of the Portrait to create a line drawing and stencil to transfer to Farmer’s arm, then completed the tattoo freehand. Kat Von D and the tattoo shop hosting her both posted a photograph of Kat Von D tattooing Farmer’s arm with the Portrait in the background, as well as a photograph of the finished tattoo. Kat Von D also posted a short video of herself inking the tattoo. Sedlik sued and moved for summary judgment on his claim of copyright infringement. Defendants moved for summary judgment, asserting fair use.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Whether use of a photograph as the reference image for a realistic tattoo is fair use.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Considering the first fair use factor, the purpose and character of the use, the court found triable issues as to the transformativeness and commercial nature of the work. The court rejected Kat Von D’s arguments that the tattoo was transformative because of Farmer’s personal connection to the image in the Portrait and by nature of it being permanently imprinted on Farmer’s body. The court concluded that a jury should determine whether the visual differences between the Portrait and the tattoo, such as additional shading and the elimination of the black background, are significant enough to render the tattoo transformative. The court also stated that a jury should decide whether Kat Von D’s use of the work was commercial, noting that she did not charge Farmer for the tattoo but could have derived an indirect economic benefit from promotion of the tattoo on social media. The court found that the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, favored fair use because although the Portrait is creative, it was published several decades ago and has been widely disseminated. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, weighed against fair use because Kat Von D chose to copy certain expressive elements of the Portrait that were not necessary to achieve her stated purpose of expressing “a sentiment of melancholy.” On the fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, while the court concluded the tattoo was not a substitute in the primary market for the Portrait, it found that Sedlik raised a triable issue as to whether a future market exists for licensing the Portrait for use in creating tattoos. Because the court found triable issues concerning the statutory factors, it declined to address a non-statutory factor raised by defendants—“fundamental rights of bodily integrity and personal expression”—and concluded that fair use in this case should be decided by a jury.</td>\n",

(“Sketchworks”) is a sketch comedy company that created and owns a copyright in Vape, a stage musical that is an alleged parody of the theatrical work and film, Grease. Vape follows the same characters along roughly the same story-arc and in the same setting as Grease and incorporates portions of the film’s music. Defendants are the trustees for the individual trusts of the co-authors of Grease. Just before Vape was scheduled to be performed, Defendants sent Sketchworks and the theater where Vape was to be performed cease and desist letters, and the performances were cancelled. Sketchworks brought an action against Defendants seeking a declaratory judgment that Vape constitutes fair use of Grease, asserting that Vape is a parody that uses millennial slang, pop culture references, and exaggeration to comment on Grease and criticize its misogynistic and sexist elements. Defendants disputed that Vape is a parody and asserted that it infringes their copyright in Grease. The parties cross- moved for judgment on the pleadings.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Whether the use of protected elements, including music, plot, characters, dialogue, and setting, from a theatrical work and film to create a parodic stage musical is fair use.</td>\n",
       "      <td>The court found that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, favored fair use because Vape is a parody of Grease and is therefore transformative. Critical to this determination, the court found that Vape juxtaposed “familiar elements from Grease, such as the main characters and the plot arc, with alterations to the script and song lyrics” to highlight the experiences of Grease’s female characters and “comment on how misogynistic tendencies have both evolved since Grease was developed and remain the same.” The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, disfavored fair use because Grease’s creative expression fell “within the core of the copyright’s protective purposes.” The court, however, declined to give this factor much weight, reasoning that parodies typically copy publicly known, expressive works. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the use, weighed in favor of fair use. Although Vape took “substantial elements” from Grease, the court found that “the taking was not excessive” because use of those elements was necessary to achieve Vape’s parodic purpose and communicate its criticism of certain aspects of Grease. The fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, also weighed in favor of fair use because any potential harm to Grease’s market value for derivatives was likely “minimal.” While Vape updated some of the language and cultural references from Grease, the court found that Vape “cannot be reasonably viewed as a derivative ‘sequel to, . . . or updated remake, of Grease,’” because its updates were done “in a spirit of mockery.” Further, the court commented that any effect on the demand for derivatives attributable to Vape’s “critical nature” is not remediable under copyright law. Weighing the four factors together, the court concluded that Vape constitutes a fair use of Grease and granted Sketchworks’ motion for judgment on the pleadings.</td>\n",

Plaintiffs own copyrights in various “voluntary consensus standards,” which are developed by numerous subject matter experts under Plaintiffs’ guidance. Plaintiffs sell PDFs and hard copies of their standards and maintain reading rooms for viewing the standards. Defendant purchased hard copies of Plaintiffs’ standards and, without authorization, scanned and made digital, verbatim, copies freely available online to the public. This case concerns 191 ASTM standards, 23 NFPA standards, and 3 ASHRAE standards that Defendant claims have been incorporated by reference into federal law. Plaintiffs brought copyright, trademark, and unfair competition claims; Defendant countersued, seeking declaratory judgment. The parties filed motions for summary judgment. In 2017, the district court found that all factors weighed against fair use. On appeal, the court of appeals reversed in part and remanded the case back to the district court without a detailed discussion of the fair use factors for additional factual development. On remand, both parties again moved for summary judgment.</td>\n",

       "      <td>As directed by the court of appeals, the district court conducted a four-step fair use analysis for each of the 217 allegations of infringement, concluding that Defendant’s reproduction of 184 standards was fair use, reproduction of 32 standards was not fair use, and that portions of the reproduction of 1 standard was fair use. For all 217 standards, the court found that the fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the work, favored fair use. Having found that Defendant’s use was noncommercial, the court determined that Plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence to show some meaningful likelihood of future harm exists. The court noted that it was “less deferential” to Plaintiffs’ “conclusory opinions” about market harm given that, during the elapsed time since the alleged infringement and the commencement of the litigation Plaintiffs could have provided “economic data and analysis” supporting their arguments. The court also found that Defendant’s reproductions did not have a “substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the originals.” Regarding the 184 standards that the court found Defendant reproduced fairly, the court determined that 153 were incorporated by reference into law and that the other 31 were identical in text to standards incorporated by reference. The court concluded that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, generally favored fair use because Defendant did not “stand to profit” from the reproduction and that its purpose was “to inform the public about the law and facilitate public debate.” The court noted that Defendant’s use qualified as one that “furthere[d] the purposes” of fair use, and generally provided information “essential for a private entity to comprehend its legal duties,” which weighed “heavily in favor” of fair use. In assessing the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, the court considered that “the express text of the law falls plainly outside the realm of copyright protection” and determined that consequently the standards incorporated by reference “are, at best, at the outer edge of ‘copyright's protective purposes.’” Thus, this factor weighed “heavily in favor” of fair use. The court explained that the 184 standards were incorporated into law “without limitation” such that “the consequence of the incorporation by reference is virtually indistinguishable from a situation in which the standard had been expressly copied into law.” The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, also favored fair use as the court found that “a greater amount of the standard's text might be fairly reproduced” because the incorporating regulations did “not specify” whether certain provisions, or the entire text, of the standards were incorporated by reference into law and did not indicate which specific provisions were “relevant for regulatory guidance.” Balancing the factors, the court found fair use and denied Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment regarding these 184 standards. Regarding the 32 standards that the court found were not reproduced fairly, the court noted that these standards were not shown to be incorporated by reference into law and “differ[ed] in substantive ways from those incorporated by reference into law.” Discussing the first factor, the court found that this factor weighed slightly against fair use because Defendant’s purpose of “inform[ing] the public about the law” was not “significantly furthered” by publishing standards with substantive differences from the standards that were incorporated by reference. The second factor weighed against fair use because there was no evidence showing that the standards were incorporated into law. And, although the standards were more factual than creative, the court concluded that these works “fall more squarely within the realm of copyright protection” than standards incorporated into law. The third factor weighed against fair use, as Defendant’s purpose of informing the public about the law “could be achieved with a paraphrase or summary.” The court also noted that “[i]ncorporating one standard by reference does not justify posting provisions of a different version that has not been incorporated into law.” Balancing these factors, the court did not find fair use and denied Defendant’s motion for summary judgment regarding these 32 standards. Regarding the 1 standard where the court found that portions of the reproduced standard were used fairly, only the parts incorporated by reference into a regulation were found to be fair use. In its second factor analysis, distinguishing the portions not incorporated into law, the court found that Defendant’s “wholesale reproduction” of the standard was “harder to justify” because only parts of the standard were incorporated into law.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Plaintiff Stephen Yang (“Yang”) licensed a photograph he took of Dan Rochkind (“Rochkind”) to the New York Post, which ran the photograph in an article about Rochkind entitled “Why I Won’t Date Hot Women Anymore.” Defendant Mic Network, Inc. (“Mic”) posted its own article entitled “Twitter Is Skewering the 'New York Post' for a Piece on Why a Man ‘Won't Date Hot Women’.” The Mic article included a screenshot of the Post article that captured the headline and a portion of Yang’s photograph. Mic did not obtain a license to use the photograph. In response, Yang sued Mic for copyright infringement, and Mic moved to dismiss, asserting fair use. The district court granted Mic’s motion, concluding that its use of Yang’s photograph was fair use. Yang appealed the order and judgment.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Whether using a screenshot from an article, including part of a photograph, to report on and criticize the article constitutes fair use of the photograph.</td>\n",
       "      <td>On appeal, the court decided that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, weighed in favor of fair use. As an initial matter, the panel held that it was not error for the district to decide transformativeness on a motion to dismiss in this case because the only two pieces of evidence needed were the original and secondary works. The court held that, in addition to identifying the subject of Mic’s criticism, Mic, also transformed the photograph by critiquing and providing commentary on the Post article. Mic did not use the photograph “merely as an illustrative aid,” and thus its use was for different purpose than the original. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, had limited weight in the court’s analysis after it held that the use was transformative and thus “d[id] not counsel against a finding of fair use.” Likewise, the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, did not disfavor fair use as the court agreed with the district court’s conclusion that Mic’s use of the image was reasonable to satirize the Post article. The court determined that the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, also favored fair use. The court concluded that Mic’s screenshot was not a competing substitute for Yang’s work because Mic did not simply republish the photograph, but instead used a screenshot consisting of a “significantly” cropped version of the work along with the Post headline. Further, Yang failed to plausibly allege that a market exists for “photographs that happen to be featured in news articles criticizing the original article in which the photograph appeared.” Weighing the factors together, the court concluded that the district court properly dismissed Yang’s copyright infringement claim on fair use grounds.</td>\n",

In 1995, after obtaining permission from Picasso’s estate to publish a work illustrating and describing works by Picasso, Defendants Alan Wofsy and his company Alan Wofsy & Associates began publishing The Picasso Project—–a series of volumes reproducing images of Picasso’s work, including 1,492 photographs from the Zervos Catalogue. Plaintiffs sued for copyright infringement. A French court held the photographs were protected by copyright because they “added creative features through deliberate choices of lighting, the lens, filters, [and] framing or angle of view.” In 2001, Plaintiffs obtained a judgment in France that subjected Defendants to damages for any further acts of infringement. In 2012, after discovering copies of The Picasso Project in a French bookstore, Plaintiffs enforced their judgment in France and were awarded €2 million. Plaintiffs sought recognition of the judgment in the U.S. courts. The district court granted summary judgment for Defendants, determining that the French judgment was “repugnant to U.S. public policy protecting free expression” because it failed to provide a fair use defense. Plaintiffs appealed; and Defendants cross-appealed on other defenses.   \n",

Defendant Katherine Von Drachenberg, professionally known as Kat Von D, is a celebrity tattooist. In 2017, Kat Von D inked a tattoo on the arm of a friend, Blake Farmer, as a gift. Farmer chose the Portrait as the reference image for his tattoo. Kat Von D traced a printout of the Portrait to create a line drawing and stencil to transfer to Farmer’s arm, then completed the tattoo freehand. Kat Von D and the tattoo shop hosting her both posted a photograph of Kat Von D tattooing Farmer’s arm with the Portrait in the background, as well as a photograph of the finished tattoo. Kat Von D also posted a short video of herself inking the tattoo. Sedlik sued and moved for summary judgment on his claim of copyright infringement.

Vape follows the same characters along roughly the same story-arc and in the same setting as Grease and incorporates portions of the film’s music. Defendants are the trustees for the individual trusts of the co-authors of Grease. Just before Vape was scheduled to be performed, Defendants sent Sketchworks and the theater where Vape was to be performed cease and desist letters, and the performances were cancelled. Sketchworks brought an action against Defendants seeking a declaratory judgment that Vape constitutes fair use of Grease, asserting that Vape is a parody that uses millennial slang, pop culture references, and exaggeration to comment on Grease and criticize its misogynistic and sexist elements. Defendants disputed that Vape is a parody and asserted that it infringes their copyright in Grease. The parties cross- moved for judgment on the pleadings.   \n",
       "3  Defendant Public.Resource.Org, Inc., a non-profit organization, has a mission to make the “law and other government materials more widely available so that people, businesses, and organizations can easily read and discuss [the] laws and the operations of government.” Plaintiffs consist of three non-profit standards-developing organizations: (1) “ASTM,” which is focused on industry-related technical and safety standards; (2) “NFPA,” which is focused on safety standards; and (3) “ASHRAE,” which is focused on construction-related standards. Plaintiffs own copyrights in various “voluntary consensus standards,” which are developed by numerous subject matter experts under Plaintiffs’ guidance. Plaintiffs sell PDFs and hard copies of their standards and maintain reading rooms for viewing the standards. Defendant purchased hard copies of Plaintiffs’ standards and, without authorization, scanned and made digital, verbatim, copies freely available online to the public. This case concerns 191 ASTM standards, 23 NFPA standards, and 3 ASHRAE standards that Defendant claims have been incorporated by reference into federal law. Plaintiffs brought copyright, trademark, and unfair competition claims; Defendant countersued, seeking declaratory judgment. The parties filed motions for summary judgment. In 2017, the district court found that all factors weighed against fair use. On appeal, the court of appeals reversed in part and remanded the case back to the district court without a detailed discussion of the fair use factors for additional factual development. On remand, both parties again moved for summary judgment.   \n",

Specifically, the court noted that Defendants’ use “did not serve an ‘entirely different function’ than the originals,” but had overlapping purposes, and the insertion of informative captions did not “necessarily” transform the works. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, did not favor fair use because, although the works were published and documentary in nature, the French court had concluded that the photographs exhibited creative elements. The court determined that the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, weighed against fair use because Defendants failed to demonstrate that “copying the entirety of each photograph was necessary.” The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, also weighed against fair use because there is a presumption of market harm when the use is commercial and non-transformative. Although Defendants presented evidence that auction prices for the Zervos Catalogue increased while The Picasso Project was on the market, Defendants had not provided evidence that “widespread appropriation” of the works would not harm the market for the photographs. Weighing all the factors, the court had “serious doubts” that fair use would protect Defendants’ use, and, accordingly, granted summary judgment to Plaintiffs on the public policy defense.   \n",

The court rejected Kat Von D’s arguments that the tattoo was transformative because of Farmer’s personal connection to the image in the Portrait and by nature of it being permanently imprinted on Farmer’s body. The court concluded that a jury should determine whether the visual differences between the Portrait and the tattoo, such as additional shading and the elimination of the black background, are significant enough to render the tattoo transformative. The court also stated that a jury should decide whether Kat Von D’s use of the work was commercial, noting that she did not charge Farmer for the tattoo but could have derived an indirect economic benefit from promotion of the tattoo on social media. The court found that the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, favored fair use because although the Portrait is creative, it was published several decades ago and has been widely disseminated. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, weighed against fair use because Kat Von D chose to copy certain expressive elements of the Portrait that were not necessary to achieve her stated purpose of expressing “a sentiment of melancholy.” On the fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, while the court concluded the tattoo was not a substitute in the primary market for the Portrait, it found that Sedlik raised a triable issue as to whether a future market exists for licensing the Portrait for use in creating tattoos. Because the court found triable issues concerning the statutory factors, it declined to address a non-statutory factor raised by defendants—“fundamental rights of bodily integrity and personal expression”—and concluded that fair use in this case should be decided by a jury.   \n",

Critical to this determination, the court found that Vape juxtaposed “familiar elements from Grease, such as the main characters and the plot arc, with alterations to the script and song lyrics” to highlight the experiences of Grease’s female characters and “comment on how misogynistic tendencies have both evolved since Grease was developed and remain the same.” The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, disfavored fair use because Grease’s creative expression fell “within the core of the copyright’s protective purposes.” The court, however, declined to give this factor much weight, reasoning that parodies typically copy publicly known, expressive works. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the use, weighed in favor of fair use. Although Vape took “substantial elements” from Grease, the court found that “the taking was not excessive” because use of those elements was necessary to achieve Vape’s parodic purpose and communicate its criticism of certain aspects of Grease. The fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, also weighed in favor of fair use because any potential harm to Grease’s market value for derivatives was likely “minimal.” While Vape updated some of the language and cultural references from Grease, the court found that Vape “cannot be reasonably viewed as a derivative ‘sequel to, . . . or updated remake, of Grease,’” because its updates were done “in a spirit of mockery.” Further, the court commented that any effect on the demand for derivatives attributable to Vape’s “critical nature” is not remediable under copyright law. Weighing the four factors together, the court concluded that Vape constitutes a fair use of Grease and granted Sketchworks’ motion for judgment on the pleadings.   \n",
       "3  As directed by the court of appeals, the district court conducted a four-step fair use analysis for each of the 217 allegations of infringement, concluding that Defendant’s reproduction of 184 standards was fair use, reproduction of 32 standards was not fair use, and that portions of the reproduction of 1 standard was fair use. For all 217 standards, the court found that the fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the work, favored fair use. Having found that Defendant’s use was noncommercial, the court determined that Plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence to show some meaningful likelihood of future harm exists. The court noted that it was “less deferential” to Plaintiffs’ “conclusory opinions” about market harm given that, during the elapsed time since the alleged infringement and the commencement of the litigation Plaintiffs could have provided “economic data and analysis” supporting their arguments. The court also found that Defendant’s reproductions did not have a “substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the originals.” Regarding the 184 standards that the court found Defendant reproduced fairly, the court determined that 153 were incorporated by reference into law and that the other 31 were identical in text to standards incorporated by reference. The court concluded that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, generally favored fair use because Defendant did not “stand to profit” from the reproduction and that its purpose was “to inform the public about the law and facilitate public debate.” The court noted that Defendant’s use qualified as one that “furthere[d] the purposes” of fair use, and generally provided information “essential for a private entity to comprehend its legal duties,” which weighed “heavily in favor” of fair use. In assessing the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, the court considered that “the express text of the law falls plainly outside the realm of copyright protection” and determined that consequently the standards incorporated by reference “are, at best, at the outer edge of ‘copyright's protective purposes.’” Thus, this factor weighed “heavily in favor” of fair use. The court explained that the 184 standards were incorporated into law “without limitation” such that “the consequence of the incorporation by reference is virtually indistinguishable from a situation in which the standard had been expressly copied into law.” The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, also favored fair use as the court found that “a greater amount of the standard's text might be fairly reproduced” because the incorporating regulations did “not specify” whether certain provisions, or the entire text, of the standards were incorporated by reference into law and did not indicate which specific provisions were “relevant for regulatory guidance.” Balancing the factors, the court found fair use and denied Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment regarding these 184 standards. Regarding the 32 standards that the court found were not reproduced fairly, the court noted that these standards were not shown to be incorporated by reference into law and “differ[ed] in substantive ways from those incorporated by reference into law.” Discussing the first factor, the court found that this factor weighed slightly against fair use because Defendant’s purpose of “inform[ing] the public about the law” was not “significantly furthered” by publishing standards with substantive differences from the standards that were incorporated by reference. The second factor weighed against fair use because there was no evidence showing that the standards were incorporated into law. And, although the standards were more factual than creative, the court concluded that these works “fall more squarely within the realm of copyright protection” than standards incorporated into law. The third factor weighed against fair use, as Defendant’s purpose of informing the public about the law “could be achieved with a paraphrase or summary.” The court also noted that “[i]ncorporating one standard by reference does not justify posting provisions of a different version that has not been incorporated into law.” Balancing these factors, the court did not find fair use and denied Defendant’s motion for summary judgment regarding these 32 standards. Regarding the 1 standard where the court found that portions of the reproduced standard were used fairly, only the parts incorporated by reference into a regulation were found to be fair use. In its second factor analysis, distinguishing the portions not incorporated into law, the court found that Defendant’s “wholesale reproduction” of the standard was “harder to justify” because only parts of the standard were incorporated into law.   \n",

As an initial matter, the panel held that it was not error for the district to decide transformativeness on a motion to dismiss in this case because the only two pieces of evidence needed were the original and secondary works. The court held that, in addition to identifying the subject of Mic’s criticism, Mic, also transformed the photograph by critiquing and providing commentary on the Post article. Mic did not use the photograph “merely as an illustrative aid,” and thus its use was for different purpose than the original. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, had limited weight in the court’s analysis after it held that the use was transformative and thus “d[id] not counsel against a finding of fair use.” Likewise, the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, did not disfavor fair use as the court agreed with the district court’s conclusion that Mic’s use of the image was reasonable to satirize the Post article. The court determined that the fourth factor, the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work, also favored fair use. The court concluded that Mic’s screenshot was not a competing substitute for Yang’s work because Mic did not simply republish the photograph, but instead used a screenshot consisting of a “significantly” cropped version of the work along with the Post headline. Further, Yang failed to plausibly allege that a market exists for “photographs that happen to be featured in news articles criticizing the original article in which the photograph appeared.” Weighing the factors together, the court concluded that the district court properly dismissed Yang’s copyright infringement claim on fair use grounds.   \n",

       "      <td>Plaintiffs own the rights to a catalogue comprised of 16,000 photographs of Pablo Picasso’s work, which was originally compiled by Picasso’s friend in 1932 (the “Zervos Catalogue”). In 1995, after obtaining permission from Picasso’s estate to publish a work illustrating and describing works by Picasso, Defendants Alan Wofsy and his company Alan Wofsy &amp; Associates began publishing The Picasso Project—–a series of volumes reproducing images of Picasso’s work, including 1,492 photographs from the Zervos Catalogue. Plaintiffs sued for copyright infringement. A French court held the photographs were protected by copyright because they “added creative features through deliberate choices of lighting, the lens, filters, [and] framing or angle of view.” In 2001, Plaintiffs obtained a judgment in France that subjected Defendants to damages for any further acts of infringement. In 2012, after discovering copies of The Picasso Project in a French bookstore, Plaintiffs enforced their judgment in France and were awarded €2 million. Plaintiffs sought recognition of the judgment in the U.S. courts. The district court granted summary judgment for Defendants, determining that the French judgment was “repugnant to U.S. public policy protecting free expression” because it failed to provide a fair use defense. Plaintiffs appealed; and Defendants cross-appealed on other defenses.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The panel held that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, weighed against fair use because Defendants conceded that The Picasso Project was a commercial venture and the use at issue—reproduction of the photographs in a book illustrating Picasso’s works—was not transformative. Specifically, the court noted that Defendants’ use “did not serve an ‘entirely different function’ than the originals,” but had overlapping purposes, and the insertion of informative captions did not “necessarily” transform the works. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, did not favor fair use because, although the works were published and documentary in nature, the French court had concluded that the photographs exhibited creative elements. The court determined that the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, weighed against fair use because Defendants failed to demonstrate that “copying the entirety of each photograph was necessary.” The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, also weighed against fair use because there is a presumption of market harm when the use is commercial and non-transformative. Although Defendants presented evidence that auction prices for the Zervos Catalogue increased while The Picasso Project was on the market, Defendants had not provided evidence that “widespread appropriation” of the works would not harm the market for the photographs. Weighing all the factors, the court had “serious doubts” that fair use would protect Defendants’ use, and, accordingly, granted summary judgment to Plaintiffs on the public policy defense.</td>\n",

In 1995, after obtaining permission from Picasso’s estate to publish a work illustrating and describing works by Picasso, Defendants Alan Wofsy and his company Alan Wofsy & Associates began publishing The Picasso Project—–a series of volumes reproducing images of Picasso’s work, including 1,492 photographs from the Zervos Catalogue. Plaintiffs sued for copyright infringement. A French court held the photographs were protected by copyright because they “added creative features through deliberate choices of lighting, the lens, filters, [and] framing or angle of view.” In 2001, Plaintiffs obtained a judgment in France that subjected Defendants to damages for any further acts of infringement. In 2012, after discovering copies of The Picasso Project in a French bookstore, Plaintiffs enforced their judgment in France and were awarded €2 million. Plaintiffs sought recognition of the judgment in the U.S. courts. The district court granted summary judgment for Defendants, determining that the French judgment was “repugnant to U.S. public policy protecting free expression” because it failed to provide a fair use defense. Plaintiffs appealed; and Defendants cross-appealed on other defenses.   \n",

       "holding      The panel held that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, weighed against fair use because Defendants conceded that The Picasso Project was a commercial venture and the use at issue—reproduction of the photographs in a book illustrating Picasso’s works—was not transformative. Specifically, the court noted that Defendants’ use “did not serve an ‘entirely different function’ than the originals,” but had overlapping purposes, and the insertion of informative captions did not “necessarily” transform the works. The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, did not favor fair use because, although the works were published and documentary in nature, the French court had concluded that the photographs exhibited creative elements. The court determined that the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the work used, weighed against fair use because Defendants failed to demonstrate that “copying the entirety of each photograph was necessary.” The fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, also weighed against fair use because there is a presumption of market harm when the use is commercial and non-transformative. Although Defendants presented evidence that auction prices for the Zervos Catalogue increased while The Picasso Project was on the market, Defendants had not provided evidence that “widespread appropriation” of the works would not harm the market for the photographs. Weighing all the factors, the court had “serious doubts” that fair use would protect Defendants’ use, and, accordingly, granted summary judgment to Plaintiffs on the public policy defense.   \n",

Monsarrat subsequently registered his post with the U.S. Copyright Office in 2012. In 2017, LiveJournal revised its terms of service to comply with Russian law, which permitted censorship. As a result, Defendant Ron Newman moved the forum, including Monsarrat’s registered post, to another platform, Dreamwidth, by copying the forum’s discussion threads and reposting them on Dreamwidth.

The revised policy required professors to complete a form to determine whether the fair use doctrine permitted them to post materials electronically for students to access. After establishing some general fair use guidelines for its analysis, the district court individually reviewed 74 violations plaintiffs alleged were the result of continuing infringement under the revised 2009 fair use policy.

In 1988, defendant authorized plaintiff Video Pipeline to create compilations of its video trailers and distribute the trailers to traditional home video retail outlets. In 1997, when the video retail market shifted to an internet distribution model, plaintiff began distributing the trailers over the internet, via digital streams, and charging internet video retailers for the right to access the trailers. In 2000, defendant advised plaintiff that it did not have permission to distribute its trailers on the internet. In response, plaintiff filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that its online use of the trailers was legal pursuant to a previous licensing agreement. Defendant subsequently terminated the licensing agreement. After the licensing agreement was cancelled, plaintiff began using short segments from defendant’s films to create its own movie trailers and stream them over the internet. Plaintiff then sought a declaratory judgment that its use of the segments was permissible. Defendant claimed plaintiff’s use of the segments or “clip previews” infringed its copyrights in the films.

Monsarrat’s post responded to allegedly defamatory posts about him on the thread by threatening to report the other users for violations of LiveJournal’s harassment policy, which he quoted and linked to in the post. Monsarrat subsequently registered his post with the U.S. Copyright Office in 2012. In 2017, LiveJournal revised its terms of service to comply with Russian law, which permitted censorship. As a result, Defendant Ron Newman moved the forum, including Monsarrat’s registered post, to another platform, Dreamwidth, by copying the forum’s discussion threads and reposting them on Dreamwidth. Monsarrat sued for copyright infringement and Newman moved to dismiss the claim, asserting fair use. The district court held that Newman’s reproduction of the post as part of the discussion thread was fair use. Monsarrat appealed.   \n",

Bell separately registered the copyright for a 230-word excerpt from the book (the “WIN Passage”). Bell sells merchandise that displays the WIN Passage online and licenses its use. In December 2017, Chisholm Trail High School’s softball team and color guard posted the WIN Passage to their Twitter accounts, crediting Bell as the author. In November 2018, Bell notified Defendant Eagle Mountain Saginaw Independent School District that the Twitter posts infringed his copyright. In response, Defendant removed both posts, told Bell that the mistake was a “teachable moment,” and announced a training program to avoid similar incidents. After settlement negotiations failed, Bell brought an action for copyright infringement. Defendant moved to dismiss, asserting that the school’s use was fair. The district court granted Defendant’s motion and awarded it attorney’s fees. Bell appealed.   \n",

The Metropolitan Museum of Art (the “Met”), a nonprofit museum that displays works of art to the public, included the Photograph in an online catalogue for a physical exhibition on rock and roll instruments. The catalogue included 185 webpages representing the exhibit objects on physical display. The Photograph was displayed as a thumbnail image on the webpage discussing the “Frankenstein” guitar, along with a large photograph of the guitar, two thumbnail images, and two paragraphs of text describing the guitar’s history and technical specifications. Online visitors could click on the Photograph’s thumbnail to view a larger version of it. Marano sued the Met for willful copyright infringement, and the district court found that the Met’s use of the Photograph was a fair use. Marano appealed.   \n",

At the same time, Dish introduced a feature called PrimeTime Anytime with AutoHop. PrimeTime Anytime allowed subscribers to set a single timer to record primetime programming on major broadcast networks, including plaintiff Fox Broadcasting Co.’s (Fox’s) programs. Dish subscribers had to enable the service, and copies were stored on the DVR for a number of days pre-selected by Dish. AutoHop allowed subscribers to automatically skip commercials, after the time points of those commercials were indexed by Dish, using “quality assurance” copies of Fox’s works. Fox alleged direct and contributory infringement, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction because Fox had not established a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims. Fox Broad. Co. v. Dish Network LLC., 723 F.3d 1067 (9th Cir. 2013) amended and reh’g en banc denied, 747 F.3d 1060 (9th Cir. 2014). In this subsequent district court proceeding, the parties filed motions for summary judgment which addressed, among other issues, whether Dish’s PrimeTime Anytime with Autohop features constituted fair use.   \n",

(eBay) infringed the copyrights in several of his works, including a set of photographs that plaintiff licensed for use in physical magazines. Plaintiff claimed that eBay violated his copyrights in the set of photographs by: (1) hosting user generated listings for the resale of the physical magazines that displayed digital pictures of physical prints of his photographs as they originally appeared in the magazines, and (2) relying on servers maintained by a content delivery network (CDN) to facilitate the display of the digital pictures of his photographs to eBay’s end users.

(“Penguin”) owned the publication rights to the following four works: Oil! by Upton Sinclair; It Can’t Happen Here, by Sinclair Lewis; E.J. Kinney’s translation of The Golden Ass, by Apuleius; and R.E. Lantham’s translation of On the Nature of Things, by Lucretius (collectively, “the Works”). American Buddha digitized and published the text of each Work, in its entirety, on its various websites. The text American Buddha included on its websites was identical to the Penguin-controlled text, but contained formatting alterations such as bold print, links and images. Penguin filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, seeking to enjoin American Buddha from directly or indirectly infringing its copyrights in the Works. This decision pertains to the district court’s disposition of Penguin’s motion for summary judgment on its claim for injunctive relief.   \n",

After the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia granted defendants’ summary judgment on plaintiffs’ claims of direct and vicarious infringement, it considered plaintiffs’ allegations of continuing contributory infringement under defendants’ revised fair use policy, which was implemented in February 2009 after the suit commenced. The revised policy required professors to complete a form to determine whether the fair use doctrine permitted them to post materials electronically for students to access. After establishing some general fair use guidelines for its analysis, the district court individually reviewed 74 violations plaintiffs alleged were the result of continuing infringement under the revised 2009 fair use policy. The court held that the revised policy did not provide adequate guidelines, which caused ongoing and continuing misuse of the fair use defense and resulted in five incidents of infringement.   \n",

In 2008, a group of participating universities created defendant HathiTrust to be the administrative entity for the HathiTrust Digital Library (HDL). HDL is a shared digital repository. At the time of the litigation, HathiTrust’s membership included approximately eighty colleges, universities, and other nonprofit institutions. HDL contained digital copies of more than ten million works, “published over many centuries, written in a multitude of languages, [and] covering almost every subject imaginable.” HathiTrust used the digital copies (1) to create a database for full-text searching by the general public, (2) to permit library patrons with certified print disabilities to have access to full texts of works, and (3) to allow libraries to replace their original copies that were lost, destroyed, or stolen where a replacement was unobtainable at a fair price elsewhere. Plaintiffs, individual authors and authors’ associations, appealed the district court’s finding that defendants were entitled to the fair use defense.   \n",

The image search results were shown as reduced-sized, lower resolution “thumbnail” versions of the original images. Another aspect of plaintiff’s claim related to a business agreement Google had with Amazon.com that permitted Google’s search engine to send search results, including plaintiff’s images, to Amazon.com customers. Defendants appealed the district court’s grant of a preliminary injunction enjoining Google from creating and publicly displaying thumbnail versions of plaintiff’s images.   \n",

       "15  Defendant Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of The Walt Disney Pictures and Television Co., held an exclusive license to distribute Disney products in the home video market. In 1988, defendant authorized plaintiff Video Pipeline to create compilations of its video trailers and distribute the trailers to traditional home video retail outlets. In 1997, when the video retail market shifted to an internet distribution model, plaintiff began distributing the trailers over the internet, via digital streams, and charging internet video retailers for the right to access the trailers. In 2000, defendant advised plaintiff that it did not have permission to distribute its trailers on the internet. In response, plaintiff filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that its online use of the trailers was legal pursuant to a previous licensing agreement. Defendant subsequently terminated the licensing agreement. After the licensing agreement was cancelled, plaintiff began using short segments from defendant’s films to create its own movie trailers and stream them over the internet. Plaintiff then sought a declaratory judgment that its use of the segments was permissible. Defendant claimed plaintiff’s use of the segments or “clip previews” infringed its copyrights in the films. Plaintiff argued that its use was protected by the first sale and fair use doctrines. The district court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of defendant.   \n",

In return for downloading pirated software, PWA required members to participate in some aspect of its operations, such as procuring the software, eliminating internal copyright protections, or testing software before it could be uploaded to the group’s servers. Ultimately, the FBI seized the group’s server, and several members were indicted for criminal copyright infringement. At trial, the district court denied defendants’ request to instruct the jury on the fair use defense.   \n",

Defendant reproduced thirty-five of plaintiff’s photographs and displayed them as thumbnails in response to search requests. Plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling that defendant’s use of plaintiff’s photographs in its search engine was fair use.   \n",

Plaintiffs, corporate music producers, complained that Napster users obtained copyrighted works from each other’s networked computers without copyright holders’ authorization. Napster asserted that the service had legitimate purposes: sampling works in deciding whether to make a purchase; accessing works the users already owned (space-shifting); and receiving authorized distributions of copyrighted works. Plaintiffs alleged Napster was liable for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement as a result of its operation of the P2P network. The district court granted plaintiffs a preliminary injunction, finding in part that Napster’s P2P file-sharing service was not a fair use of copyrighted works. Napster appealed.   \n",
